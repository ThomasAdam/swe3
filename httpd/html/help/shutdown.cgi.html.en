<P>This page contains two buttons, "Shutdown" and "Reboot". When the machine
has finished shutting down, SmoothWall will beep once indicating that you
can disconnect the power. You should, generally, not have to reboot a
SmoothWall unless you have just applied a patch and it requires you to do
so.</P>

<P>Alternatively, you can shutdown SmoothWall from the console. Press
Ctrl+Alt+Del to start the shutdown sequence, as per the Shutdown button. The
machine will NOT reboot.</P>
