<p>SmoothWall Express has the ability to allow or disalow Inetnet access at
certain times of the day, for a specified group of local machines.</p>

<p>If this ability is required, <strong>Enable</strong> it with the checkbox.</p>

<p>Timed access works in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Allow at specified times:</strong> In this mode, Internet access
is allowed only at the times specified.</li>
<li><strong>Reject at specified times:</strong> In this mode, Internet access
is blocked at the times specified.</li>
</ul>

<p>To specify a time to apply the rule, choose a hour and minute <strong>From</strong>
which to start the access rule and a <strong>To</strong> time to end the access rule.</p>

<p>Note that the <strong>From</strong> time must be chronologically before the
<strong>To</strong> time.  If you require, for example, the ability to block
access between 21:00 one day and 07:00 the next, you should reverse the sense
of the rule and instead allow access between 07:00 and 21:00. This will have the
same effect.</p>

<p>In addition to setting a range of times, the <strong>Days</strong> the rule
is to apply for must also be selected.  This enables you to perform your blocking
(or allowing) only on certain days in the week such as weekdays.</p>

<p>The timed access controls are only performed on the listed
<strong>Machines</strong>. You should enter one IP address or network with
netmask per line in the supplied text box. e.g. 192.168.168.0/24 will
block/allow the entire range of 192.168.168.0 through 192.168.168.255;
alternatively it can be entered 192.168.168.0/255.255.255.0</p>

<p>Press <strong>Save</strong> to enable or disable the timed access rules.</p>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> All access to the Internet and to the SmoothWall
itself is blocked using this page.  This includes the ability to administer
the SmoothWall on its web interface.</p>
